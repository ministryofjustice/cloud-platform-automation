## Release Process

- The release process is automated using GitHub Actions. 
- The release process is triggered by creating a new tag in the repository. The tag should be in the format `X.Y.Z` where `X.Y.Z` is the version number.
- The release process will build and release the binaries for the tag and create a GitHub release with the binaries attached.
- The release process will also update the `latest` tag to point to the new release.
- All the scripts use the same Dockerfile to build the binaries. The Dockerfile is located in the root of the repository. It will be populated with the necessary tools and dependencies to build the binary, this is done by the `.goreleaser.yaml` file. that sits in the each of the script directories.
